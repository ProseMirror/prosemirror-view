ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This [module](http://prosemirror.net/ref.html#view) exports the editor
view, which renders the current document in the browser, and handles
user events.

The [project page](http://prosemirror.net) has more information, a
number of [demos](http://prosemirror.net/#demos) and the
[documentation](http://prosemirror.net/docs.html).

**NOTE:** This project is in *BETA* stage. It isn't thoroughly tested,
and the API might still change across `0.x` releases. You are welcome
to use it, but don't expect it to be very stable yet.
